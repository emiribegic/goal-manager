## Description

Goal Manager displays goals and relevant tasks added or modified on [Airtable](https://airtable.com/). By showing the deadline and the progress at each goal, users can use this app as a means of holding themselves accountable for their determinations. After completing all the tasks, a greyed-out checkmark next to the goal name will appear green to visualize completion.
